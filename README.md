A path finding board game played on a hexagonal grid.
The card deck includes rule modifiers to play for more variation.

# How to make
Print out PDF file to make cards.

# TODO
-Add board game layout, hexagon with length 12 edges. 6*(11*12)/2+1=397
-Try two triangle stacks together as a parallelogram. Put three of these together joined in the center

# TODO: 3D printing
-spherical cow, six cows, one target for each in all three board pieces
-target wall locations \_/, etc. 
-center locking piece

# Rule modifers
-billiards
-tunneling through wall
-magnetic repulsion
-Non-target may take one step
-Non-target may edge jump
-After Non-target move, may rotate target locations
-transparent center
-slower speed of light: As a robot moves 1 square at a time, other robts may move and interact with it
-stop on partial walls (NT only?)
-Move to antipodal point
-wrapping move at edges
